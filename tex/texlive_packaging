Texlive Packages in Pardus
--------------------------

**Current state of Texlive 2009**

We have actionsapi module named _texlivemodules_ that has several file
generating and populating scripts for thexlive collections. This module is a one
a one copy of the Gentoo texlive eclasses. The texlive tarballs are all created
custom from the depending Gentoo ebuilds. This was done with a script that
parses the gentoo ebuilds and created a tarball for pisi packaging.

The main problem with this main workflow is the dependence to Gentoo ebuilds.
Also it and hacky and ugly way to create this packages. We dont even know what
the source of this packages are. This worklfow was also the same in Pardus 2008,
pardus 2009. We just continued it in Pardus 2011. Our whole Texlive
infrastructure was based on Gentoo.

We have a component named "Tex" that contains all TeX spesific packages and
applications. The component itself has five directories (that is the current
state and will change with the upcoming Texlive 2011). These directories are:

addon:      contains texlive collections and latex spesific modules
base:       contains basic and essential texlive collections and binaries
doc:        contains texlive documentations about languages
language:   contains texlive's langfoo collections
tool:       contains several tools and applications (such as kile,lyx) to work with
            tex itself

As you see four of the sub components are depending on Texlive itself. The addon
itself contains modules that are not Texlive spesific. Texlive collections are
mixed up with non-Texlive modules.
